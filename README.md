## Hi, I’m Kashif 👋

I’m a **backend engineer** working at the intersection of **distributed systems** and **applied AI**.  
My core strength is building **production-grade services** and progressively integrating **LLMs and AI workflows** into real-world systems — with a strong focus on **reliability, cost control, and scalability**.

I care less about demos and more about systems that survive **real traffic, real failures, and real constraints**.

---

## 💼 What I Do
- Design and build **backend-heavy systems** using Java & Spring Boot
- Work with **microservices**, APIs, and data-heavy workflows
- Integrate **LLM APIs** (OpenAI / open-source models) into backend services
- Think deeply about **observability, performance, and cost**
- Translate AI ideas into **deployable, maintainable systems**

---

## 🔍 Current Focus
- Building **LLM-powered backend services** (agents, OCR → LLM pipelines, RAG-style flows)
- Designing **clean service boundaries** for AI features in microservice architectures
- Understanding **failure modes** of AI systems in production
- Cost-aware AI usage (token budgeting, async execution, retries, fallbacks)
- Improving depth in **system design + AI infrastructure fundamentals**

---

## 🧪 Selected Projects & Work

### AI-Powered Backend Services
Spring Boot–based services that integrate LLMs for:
- intelligent text processing
- document & OCR pipelines
- domain-specific automation  

with emphasis on **clean APIs**, **security**, and **cost control**.

---

### Microservices & Platform Engineering
Experience building and maintaining large enterprise systems involving:
- agent onboarding & role-based access
- multi-service communication
- legacy-to-modern system migration
- production debugging and system hardening

---

### LLM Experimentation & Tooling
Hands-on work with:
- prompt design & structured outputs
- backend wrappers around LLM APIs
- early exploration of agent-style workflows
- running and evaluating open-source models locally

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Java, Spring Boot
- REST APIs, Microservices

**AI / LLM**
- OpenAI APIs
- Prompt engineering & structured outputs
- OCR → LLM pipelines
- RAG concepts & experimentation
- Local inference with open-source models

**Data**
- MySQL, PostgreSQL

**Infra & Tooling**
- Docker, Linux, WSL
- Git, GitHub Actions
- Basic AWS deployment experience

---

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset
- Production constraints matter more than hype
- AI features must be **observable and debuggable**
- Cost is a first-class system requirement
- Clear boundaries beat clever abstractions
- Systems should fail predictably, not mysteriously
